# Functions

## step(x,y)
- Inputs : 2	
- The first one is the limit or threshold.
- The second one is the value we want to check or pass.	
- Any value under the limit will return 0.0 while everything above the limit will return 1.0.	

## smoothstep(x,y,z)
- Inputs : 3	
- The two first parameters are for the beginning and end of the transition.
- The third is for the value to interpolate.
